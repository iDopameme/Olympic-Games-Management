## General info
Features: The user will be able to input a lot of data such as (but not limited to): 
•	Participants
•	Tournaments
•	Medal Leaderboard

•	Events/Sports (Timetables, who is participating, tournament name and ID, etc.)
•	Inserting/Removing/Changing who is participating (Name, Age, Country, etc.)
•	Score tracking of each game
•	Results overall => determines who gets the medal
•	And many more ...

This application will work as how an Olympic Games is organized. The general purpose of this program is to input specific data and have that data be used in methods that will compile them into one section. For example, 
the scores of the game will determine who will get the gold,silver, and 
bronze medal. The data will automatically compile things such as 
participants that are playing in the same event, the winners of each event, 
and the overall scores. In the end, it would display everything that was inputted. 

## Technologies
Project is designed with:
* Java ver. 15.0.1
* MySQL Connector/J ver. 8.0.21
* Amazon RDS

Application Name: The Olympic Games

Features: The user will be able to input data to play through their own custom Olympic events. User input includes (but is not limited to):
-	Types of events
-	Participants in said events
-	Tickets sold
-	Event/Sport (timetables, who is participating, tournament name and ID, etc.)

The user will also be able to insert/remove/change who participates in their tournament (Name, Age, Country, etc.) as well as track the scoring and medal distribution. 

This application will allow the user to act as an Olympic organizer, giving them access to a menu where they can choose from any of the featured actions. The user inputs data from an existing database which is then used to perform various functions, like organizing Olympic events, tracking tournament scores and results and determining medal distribution. The data can then be displayed for the user’s viewing pleasure once their tournaments are concluded.
