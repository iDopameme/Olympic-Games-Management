## General info
Features: The user will be able to input a lot of data such as (but not limited to): 
•	Participants
•	Tournaments
•	Medal Leaderboard

•	Events/Sports (Timetables, who is participating, tournament name and ID, etc.)
•	Inserting/Removing/Changing who is participating (Name, Age, Country, etc.)
•	Score tracking of each game
•	Results overall => determines who gets the medal
•	And many more ...

This application will work as how an Olympic Games is organized. The general purpose of this program is to input specific data and have that data be used in methods that will compile them into one section. For example, 
the scores of the game will determine who will get the gold,silver, and 
bronze medal. The data will automatically compile things such as 
participants that are playing in the same event, the winners of each event, 
and the overall scores. In the end, it would display everything that was inputted.
